Project:
(1) generation of initial configuration
(2a) calculating the negative gradient of the total potential energy function
(2b) total potential energy minimization
(3) sample initial velocities from the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution
(4) Solve the Hamilton's equations of motion and generate trajectories of atomic coordinates and velocities
(5) calculate mean square displacement, velocity correlation function, van Hove correlation function, and dynamic structure factor



To RUN THE CODE :

1. cd src/modules
2. python3 run.py

All the graphs will be generated ( in real time, so you'll have to close the windows for the function to proceed. 

The Graphs shall also be saved under the folder "graphs", with appropriate names, in case you want to take a better look at them
