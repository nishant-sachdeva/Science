Project:
(1) generation of initial configuration
(2a) calculating the negative gradient of the total potential energy function
(2b) total potential energy minimization
(3) sample initial velocities from the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution
(4) Solve the Hamilton's equations of motion and generate trajectories of atomic coordinates and velocities
(5) calculate mean square displacement, velocity correlation function, van Hove correlation function, and dynamic structure factor
